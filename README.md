# Chess Application
Completely custom chess application built with ReactJS. Supports basic moves, checkmate detection and enforces standard chess rules. Class structures and rule enforcement are written in Javascript; UI built with HTML/CSS

Still plan to introduce an SQLite database to store game history and implement castling.

Below are some images taken during gameplay:
