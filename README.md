# Chess Application
Completely custom chess application built with ReactJS. Supports basic moves, checkmate detection and enforces standard chess rules. Class structures and rule enforcement are written in Javascript; UI built with HTML/CSS

Still plan to introduce enums to clean up code and polish up some elements of the UI.
